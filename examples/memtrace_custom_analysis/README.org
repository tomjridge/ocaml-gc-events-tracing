Files: Most of these are based on
https://blog.janestreet.com/finding-memory-leaks-with-memtrace/ by Luke Maurer

- lifetimes_of_queued_objects.ml - from Maurer article
- lifetimes_of_objects.ml - adapted version of above, to print lifetimes of all objects
- gnuplot0.pdf - a gnuplot (as in Maurer article) of object lifetimes after filtering with
  lifetimes_of_queued_objects
- js_of_ocaml-leaky.ctf; js_of_ocaml-queue.ctf - the ctf files from the Maurer article
